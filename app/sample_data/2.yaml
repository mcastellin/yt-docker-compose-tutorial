  <br><br>STEP 1

  Put 2kg unsmoked boneless gammon joint in a large pan and cover with 2l cola. Add 1 chopped carrot, 1 quartered onion, 1 chopped celery stick, 1 cinnamon stick, ½ tbsp peppercorns and 1 bay leaf.
  <br><br>STEP 2

  Bring to the boil, then turn down to simmer for around 2 ½ hrs, topping up with boiling water if necessary to keep the gammon fully covered.
  <br><br>STEP 3

  Carefully pour the liquid away, then let the ham cool a little while you heat the oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5.
  <br><br>STEP 4

  Lift the ham into a roasting tin, then cut away the skin leaving behind an even layer of fat. Score the fat all over in a criss-cross pattern.
  <br><br>STEP 5

  Mix 150ml maple syrup, 2 tbsp wholegrain mustard, 2 tbsp red wine vinegar and a pinch of ground cloves or five-spice in a jug.
  <br><br>STEP 6

  Pour half over the fat, roast for 15 mins, then pour over the rest and return to the oven for another 30 mins, baste half way through.
  <br><br>STEP 7

  Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 10 mins, then spoon more glaze over the top. Can be roasted on the day or up to 2 days ahead and served cold.

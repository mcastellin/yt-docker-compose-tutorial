# RecipeBook

A sample web application that anyone can use to run off-the-shelf and to play around and learn application development and automation!

# How to use this repo

This repository contains a Python Flas application. The application builds and runs with `make`. To run the application simply make sure you have Python3 and make installed and run `make all`.

You can use this application for many things:

- Extend the existing code with more features and learn Python programming
- Build automation to validate and deploy the application into cloud platform (I personally like to do just that!)
